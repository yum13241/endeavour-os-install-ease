# endeavour-os-install-ease
This place helps my EndeavourOS (EnOS, EOS was taken) installs make life easier.

My ```user_commands.bash``` is here: 



```https://github.com/yum13241/endeavour-os-install-ease/blob/gh-pages/user_commands.bash.```



You can also use the


```get_user_commands.bash```, found @
```https://github.com/yum13241/endeavour-os-install-ease/blob/gh-pages/get_user_commands.bash``` 


file to get the latest version automatically. MAKE SURE TO DO WHAT YO WANT IN THE WELCOME APP FIRST because the file will kill ```eos-welcome``` AND THAT YOU HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION!
